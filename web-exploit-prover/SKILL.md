# Web Exploit Prover

## Purpose
Convert initial web vulnerability leads into high-confidence exploit outcomes.

## Inputs
- `initial_findings`
- `target_context`
- `auth_and_role_data`
- `environment_constraints`

## Evidence Levels
- `L1`: suspicious behavior only
- `L2`: exploit primitive observed
- `L3`: code path executed in attacker-controlled way
- `L4`: business impact demonstrated

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Independent Reproduction
1. Reproduce lead with alternate technique.
2. Validate preconditions and dependencies.
3. Confirm baseline-control difference.

### Phase 2: Impact Demonstration
1. Move from primitive to measurable impact.
2. Demonstrate confidentiality, integrity, or authorization breach.
3. Capture minimal proof with clear stop condition.

### Phase 3: Robustness Testing
1. Re-test across fresh session and role context.
2. Re-test with slight payload and transport changes.
3. Downgrade confidence on instability.

### Phase 4: Final Classification
1. `confirmed` when L3+ is reproducible.
2. `plausible` when primitive exists but impact blocked.
3. `disputed` when mitigation is proven.
4. `inconclusive` when environmental blockers remain.

## Output Contract
```json
{
  "confirmed_exploits": [],
  "plausible_findings": [],
  "disputed_findings": [],
  "inconclusive_findings": [],
  "impact_evidence": []
}
```

## Constraints
- No severity inflation from weak indicators.
- Distinguish security mitigation from test-environment failure.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Impact, not just signal, is demonstrated.
- [ ] Confirmation uses independent method.
- [ ] Confidence aligns with stability.

## Detailed Operator Notes
### Evidence Ladder
- Step 1: suspicious signal.
- Step 2: primitive confirmation.
- Step 3: execution/authorization breach.
- Step 4: concrete business impact.

### Variant Discipline
- Keep payload families grouped by hypothesis.
- Stop variant expansion when new runs are non-informative.
- Prefer context-correct payloads over generic sprays.

### Confounder Controls
- Re-test in a fresh session and new object state.
- Re-test with baseline payload and expected-secure payload.
- Confirm that edge cache/CDN behavior is not driving the result.

### Reporting Rules
- Include case-level timeline from trigger to impact.
- Include exploitation preconditions and limitations.
- Include clean retest steps for independent validation.

## Quick Scenarios
### Scenario A: Authorization Drift
- Baseline with owned resource.
- Replay with foreign resource identifier.
- Repeat with role shift and fresh session.
- Confirm read/write/delete differences.

### Scenario B: Input Handling Weakness
- Send syntactically valid control payload.
- Send semantically malicious variant.
- Verify parser or execution side effect.
- Re-test with content-type variation.

### Scenario C: Workflow Bypass
- Execute expected state sequence.
- Attempt out-of-order transition.
- Attempt repeated action replay.
- Confirm server-side state enforcement.

## Conditional Decision Matrix
| Condition | Action | Evidence Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Finding signal unstable | downgrade confidence and add retest plan | repeated run variance log |
| Chain link missing prerequisite | split chain and mark dependency blocker | prerequisite graph |
| Impact appears low in isolation | evaluate chain amplification paths | chain-level impact narrative |
| Mitigation claim is partial | verify alternate path and state variants | mitigation bypass check |
| Environment blocker dominates | classify inconclusive with unblock requests | blocker evidence |

## Advanced Coverage Extensions
1. Add attack-path branching for multiple privilege starting points.
2. Add defender-detection assumptions and likely monitoring signals.
3. Add rollback/cleanup verification after proof steps.
4. Add business-impact mapping to concrete assets and workflows.
5. Add reproducibility score based on run-to-run consistency.
